## Hello all

For the last couple of days I have been trying Linux. Yes. Real Linux. Linux Mint to be exact.

### Is it good?

Well, yes, absolutely. I've only ran into ONE issue I couldn't solve and that was a multi-zip file.

But who the hell thinks it's cool to use multi-zip files?

## Is it worth switching?

Yes. There's good reasoning behind it too!

- Windows 10 won't be supported
- Windows 11 fucking sucks and is bloated with AI and ads
- Steam can install Windows games (some need tinkering but the majority work fine)
- There are lots of open source options for making Windows apps compatible with Linux
- Linux Mint is super easy to use. It even has a software manager for one click installations
- Everything is *smooooooth*

I really recommend it if you're looking to move away from Windows. However, please make sure to install another hard drive. This is because Linux uses a different file system (ext4) than Windows (nfts, fat32). Which means you can't use your old drives for storage (you can transfer files, though).

That is all. Thank you for reading :)
