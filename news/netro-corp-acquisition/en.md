## Hello, I am papertek

After months of progress and discussion we have finally met an agreement to allow [Netro Corporation](https://discord.gg/Hrah28gmjy) to acquire the Theaceae Collective. Usually acquisitions are pretty scary because hey, what's going to happen to the consumer? Well, you're only here for benefits. Both of our organizations have similar values and I can assure you Theaceae Collective's values will remain the same or else the deal is off!

However, there will be some changes. The future of the Porter Robinson Wiki will be slower (wow) because priorities have shifted to rewriting Netro Corporation's stuff. But, this project remains in Netro Corp's backlog, so we will work on the wiki once we have finished. In the future, it's likely the wiki will get much needed work by Netro Corp's employees and current users of the wiki will likely have to migrate to MyNetro accounts butttt that's for a future announcement.

## What happens to Theaceae Collective websites?

Well, the Theaceae Collective still maintains these sites using Netro Corp's infrastructure. However, we will likely no longer accept requests until Theaceae Collective refreshes itself as a website builder, much like Neocities. Yes, Theaceae Collective will refresh to be a website builder with a cool editor and everything. Fun!

Anyways, I'm very tired right now and I need sleep. Joy to the future~

If you have any questions, feedback, issues, or wish to help out, you can add me on Discord <mark>@papertek</mark>, or you can E-Mail me at <john@theaceae.org>.

Thanks for reading!! :)
