2. choose the path for your article folder. for instance, we are going to go in blog and make an article there

3. create your files in your article folder. by default, the site is in english. so stick with naming your markdown file `en.md`
 - if you wish to include media, you must provide a `.media` file in your article folder

thats all! make sure to reference previous articles before creating your own.
