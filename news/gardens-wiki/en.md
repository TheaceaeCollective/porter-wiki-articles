## Hello, I am papertek

This is sort of a followup to the [previous](news/netro-corp-acquisition) news post about how we were acquired by [Netro Corporation](https://discord.gg/Hrah28gmjy). Well, due to that we now have the resources to lock in on Gardens Wiki.

## What is Gardens Wiki, yo?

Gardens Wiki is a new project we're working on. It will be a centralized wiki platform similar to Fandom, with a little bit of social media mixed in to make it fun! We never liked the heavy bloat on Fandom, and we're aware that MediaWiki editing is very clunky. So, Gardens Wiki is designed to be a simple, modern alternative to this software, making it easy to use and complete with built-in user plugins and components within its editor. The expected shipping date is Summer 2026, but that's optimistic! :3

## What happens now?

All of Theaceae's projects are now haulted while we discuss what to work on internally. Theaceae Collective's website builder that was teased is also likely cancelled due to the needs of our company. I don't announce this with a heavy heart btw, we have plenty of other ideas that could be turned into a product for our users will enjoy!

## Potaro Wiki?

Porter Robinson Wiki (potaro.wiki) has halted development until we can migrate to Gardens Wiki (so all the WIP features are actually on the site, lol). Before we do that, however, there will likely be a migration period for Potaro Wiki accounts to be converted to myNetro accounts. A myNetro account will be used to log in to all Netro Corporation and Theaceae Collective products and sites.

If you have any questions, feedback, issues, or wish to help out, you can add me on Discord <mark>@papertek</mark>, or you can E-Mail me at <john@theaceae.org>.

Thanks for reading!! :)
