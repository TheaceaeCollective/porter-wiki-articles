## You stole everything?

Absolutely everything. The codebase, the designs (redesign pending), the money, everything.

## Why did you steal everything?

Because it was funny. I was also feeling quite selfish.

## Are you giving it back?

No.

## That's cool. I love Porter Robinson and this website. Thank you for stealing everything

You're Welcome.

## The serious side

We have some tasks for the new wiki, most of which are almosttttt done... But it takes time to create something completely new. After all, this site was still a work in progress when we originally halted development. I'm really looking forward to this new future. B)

So yeah, please enjoy our work. We plan to iron out some bugs and implement quality-of-life features before we push the site into beta. You can view the checklist [here](https://github.com/TheaceaeCollective/porter-wiki-frontend/issues/2).

If you have any questions, feedback, bug reports, issues, or wish to help out, you can add me on Discord <mark>@papertek</mark>, or you can E-Mail me at <john@theaceae.org>.

Thank you for reading :)
